# Delightful Naver Webtoon

An unofficial web application for Naver Webtoon service.

## Features

- Modern and clean user interface
- Sync reading history
- Infinity scroll
-

## How it works?

This software fetches data from Naver website and mirrors them. Technically it uses CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing). So everytime you use the application, it loads data directly from the source.

> **_NOTE:_** It does not store or collect any kind of data from the origin.

**Downsides**

Since it doesn't store/collect/cache any data related to webtoon content, it feels quite slower than Naver's.
